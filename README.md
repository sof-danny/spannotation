# spannotation## Description of software
The package introduces a novel approach to image annotation and segmentation, requiring users to select just three key points on an image. These points define a triangular area representing the region of interest, which the algorithm then uses to generate a binary mask. This mask distinctly categorizes the image into two classes: drivable and non-drivable regions.

## Key applications of this package include:

1. Row Crop Management: In agricultural settings, such as cornfields, the package can segment row crops, identifying drivable paths for farm machinery and ensuring efficient navigation through the fields.
2. Off-Road Navigation: For off-road scenarios, like dirt tracks, the tool can demarcate navigable paths, assisting in the planning and navigation of off-road vehicles.
3. On-Road Navigation: In typical urban or rural roads, the package can be used to distinguish the actual road (drivable region) from its surroundings (non-drivable regions, including shoulders and adjacent land), aiding in basic navigation tasks.

This tool is particularly useful for researchers and practitioners in autonomous vehicle navigation, agricultural robotics, and geographic information systems (GIS), where accurate and efficient image segmentation is critical.

## Time comparison with dense annotation 

Spannotation saved average of **30 seconds** on one annotation of an average crop row or dirt road. 

**spannotation: 6.03 seconds** 

**Regular annotation: 40.39 seconds** 

## Installation
To install SPAnnotation, simply use pip: 

``` pip install spannotation ```

or 

If you have previously installed an older version:

```pip install --upgrade spannotation
```

## Usage on Python code Editor
Here's a quick example of how to use spannotation if you are running from a typical code editor like jupyter, VSCode, etc:


# Step 1: Install spannotation
First, install the package using pip. Run the following command in a cell in your code editor:
``` pip install spannotation ```

or 

If you have previously installed an older version:

```pip install --upgrade spannotation
```


# Step 2: Import the Package
In a new cell, import the MaskGenerator class from the package:

``` from Spannotation import MaskGenerator ```

# Step 3: Initialize the Generator
Create an instance of the MaskGenerator:
``` generator = MaskGenerator() ```

# Step 4: Process Images
Now, you can use the generator to process an image or a folder of images.

To process a single image:

``` generator.process_image('path/to/your/image.jpg', 'path/to/save/mask') ```

To process all images in a folder:

``` generator.process_folder('path/to/your/images', 'path/to/save/masks') ```

Replace 'path/to/your/image.jpg', 'path/to/your/images', and 'path/to/save/masks' with the actual paths on your system.**


## Usage on Command line / Terminal
### Installation
``` pip install spannotation ```

or 

If you have previously installed an older version:

```pip install --upgrade spannotation
```



After installing, you can use Spannotation to process images through the command line.

### Process a Single Image
- To process a single image and generate a mask:
  1. Run the command: `python3 -m Spannotation.cli`
  2. Choose option `1` for a single image.
  3. Enter the full path to your image.
  4. Enter the full path where the mask should be saved.

### Process Multiple Images in a Folder

- To process multiple images in a folder:
  1. Run the command: `python3 -m Spannotation.cli`
  2. Choose option `2` for a folder.
  3. Enter the full path to your folder containing images.
  4. Enter the full path where the masks should be saved.

## Important Notice for GUI Window

When processing images, spannotation uses OpenCV to open a GUI window for point selection. Please note:

- After the first use, the OpenCV window might not automatically come to the foreground for subsequent image processing.
- If the image window does not appear in front, please manually click on the window from your taskbar or window manager.
- This behavior can vary based on your operating system and its window management settings.
